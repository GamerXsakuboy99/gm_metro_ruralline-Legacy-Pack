# gm_metro_ruralline Legacy Pack
gm_metro_ruralline is first map in metorstroi history to be mostly outside based map. Map was released Monday of **27/02/2017**, with very version begin tested on MFIN server, (Today Metrostroi Europe).
Since then ruralline has been updated many times until V29 became it's last major update in 29.7.2017, since then there has been many new versions of the map what have not been released.

gm_metro_ruralline_legacypack is a storage for all old maps from V1 until V29 +snow, Even V30 will be part of the legacy pack even when it's fully new release.

### map info
gm_metro_ruralline is a 70% overground and 30% tunnels map build by **GamerzXsakuzboy99** when he did not have that much knowledge of the mapping, but overtime map got somewhat better until V29 was released.
This version broke almost everything from the map and it has stayed like that since 2017, But even still this fact. Map is played very often on non-ranked / ranked servers alike.
This is due the fact of simple layout what map has, only having a Left / Right trackage without any extra curves what other maps offer. Still Map is very popular among new players.
Players have been of course been waiting for update due Rocklake - depot section is very badly designed area as it was meant to be temporary. Same time all station sections are very short so map can only have 6 trains active on both tracks.

### Recommended settings
*These settings are recommended by map developer as map in it's current form is so short and has lot of faults*<br>
*These settings are only for V1 - V29 versions of the map.*
- 4 ~ 6 Trains only.
> Rocklake station is only single tracked station, so that area will have huge traffic jams, Thats why i recommended only between 4 or 6 trains.
- 3 wagons. 
> "Map supports 4 wagons too but because of miscalculated lengths, Market Street Dead-end can supports only 3 wagons, With 4 car train it will be tight as you need hit buffer with your coupler"
- Passenger numbers: 50
> This is Because the line location.
- Voltage: 850Kv
> Voltage what is used by LVP (Lakeview transport company)

##### Commands what need to be added to server.ctg
- sv_crazyphysics_defuse 0
- sv_crazyphysics_remove 0
- sv_crazyphysics_vehicles 0
- sv_crazyphysics_warning 0
> These cmds are absolute if you want to drive between Aviation university & Market street stations, As map (V29's) Are located so down in the as possible in the engine, so it causes physic engine to have a heart attack.
